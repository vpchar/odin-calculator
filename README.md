#calculator
I don't want to reinvent the wheel each and every day, that's why I am posting here my old "Scientific Calculator"

It was made about 10 years ago, back when jQuery was still "hot", and is still published as Chrome extension on my site.

Even if this is just copy/pasted, I don't consider it "cheating" because I did, indeed, write this app many years ago and it should be a proof that I can, in fact, build JavaScript calculator ;-)
