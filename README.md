I don't want to reinvent the wheel each and every day, that's why I am posting here my old "Scientific Calculator"

#About

I made this about 10 years ago, back when jQuery was still "hot", and it is still published as Chrome extension on my site.

Even if this is just copy/pasted, I don't consider it "cheating" because I did, indeed, write this app many years ago and it should be a proof that I can, in fact, build JavaScript calculator ;-)
